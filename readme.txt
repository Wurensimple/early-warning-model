Archive Notice 
This repository has been marked as Archived. The contents include hazardous electricity consumption pattern recognition models and datasets for industrial scenarios, intended for research or educational purposes.
Project Overview 
This repository contains 7 types of hazardous electricity consumption pattern recognition models for industrial applications, covering abnormal scenarios such as production halts, resumptions, overloading, and covert operations. It is suitable for energy monitoring, compliance detection, and related research.
Directory Structure 
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific hazardous electricity consumption pattern. Key folders include:
Automatic production halt: Models and data for automatic production halt detection
Ceasing operations during the day and starting at night: Detection of daytime shutdowns with nighttime resumption
Emergency production shutdowns: Models for emergency shutdown identification
Long-term production suspension: Detection of prolonged production suspensions
Operating covertly while appearing to stop: Identification of covert operations disguised as shutdowns
Overloading electricity consumption: Detection of excessive energy usage patterns
Production suspension and resumption: Models for identifying cycles

Each folder contains:
Dataset files
PyTorch-based model implementation code
Configuration files for experiments
Usage Instructions 
1. Archive Notice: The codebase is stable with no planned updates, but it remains freely available for study or reuse.
2. Quick Start: Navigate to the relevant folder and review the code comments for model logic and data formats.
3. Dependencies: Requires Python 3.8+.
